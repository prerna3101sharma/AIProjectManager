Banking Management System
This document outlines the requirements for the proposed Banking Management System to be
developed by our organization. The system shall provide secure user authentication and role-based
access for customers, bank staff, administrators, and auditors. Customers shall be able to manage
accounts, view balances, transfer funds, apply for loans, generate statements, and perform online
bill payments through web and mobile interfaces. Bank staff shall be able to create and manage
customer accounts, process transactions, review loan applications, and generate operational
reports. All financial transactions shall be recorded in real time, and user activities shall be logged
for auditing and compliance purposes.
The system shall ensure high levels of security, performance, and reliability by implementing
encryption, access control, backup mechanisms, and regulatory compliance measures such as
KYC and AML. It shall support integration with databases, payment gateways, and third-party APIs
where required. The application shall be scalable to accommodate future growth in users and
transactions, and it shall be deployed in a secure server or cloud environment to ensure availability
and data integrity
